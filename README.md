# Implementing an application with robust high availability measures.
## step 1
Provisioning two EC2 instances across separate Availability Zones for increased resilience and fault tolerance.Configuring the fundamental settings, including selecting the appropriate AMI based on application requirements, specifying the instance type, defining network settings, and providing user data for basic deployment.
## step 2
Implement a Layer 7 Application Load Balancer to efficiently distribute HTTP traffic among healthy instances, ensuring optimal performance and availability.
## step 3
Within the context of the Application Load Balancer (ALB), it is essential to establish a target group containing the designated instance group that is to be registered for receiving incoming traffic.
## step 4
In this project, we deploy two distinct security groupsâ€”one for instances and another for the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). The security group assigned to the ELB permits incoming HTTP traffic from the internet, while the security group for instances allows traffic exclusively from the Elastic Load Balancer.
## step 5
Upon accessing the DNS of the load balancer, incoming traffic seamlessly directs to the deployed instances, culminating in a smooth user experience.
